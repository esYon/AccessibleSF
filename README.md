## What it does
This app allows a user to search for a public transit route in San Francisco on Google Maps, and you'll be alerted if your final public transit destination is inaccessible, allowing you to select a more accessible path.

##Technologies:
*Python
*Flask
*Javascript
*Bootstrap
*CSS
*HTML
*Google Maps API

##Why
SF is very transit-friendly, but not as much for wheelchair-bound travelers. There are many MUNI stations throughout SF that do not have accessible elevators or platforms, and existing applications (e.g. GoogleMaps) do not provide an option for custom routing to avoid inaccessible stops.


##How we built it
*We created user stories, wireframes, and our git workflow up front. *We split into front end and back end teams. Everyone took on new learning challenges. *We determined inputs and outputs to be passed between the teams. *We researched APIs and sites for GoogleMaps, NextBus, Muni and BART. *We attempted to put it all together. *We continued to re-evaluate and modify our MVP throughout.


##What's next for AccessibleSF
*Twilio SMS texting of directions *Additional pathfinding capabilities (waypoints)
